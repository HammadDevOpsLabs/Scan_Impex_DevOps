Scan-Impex

Scan-Impex is a Laravel-based application designed for managing and processing import/export data. This project aims to leverage modern containerization and orchestration technologies to provide a robust and scalable environment. 

The project will first be dockerized using Docker and Docker Compose, and then further containerized and orchestrated using Kubernetes (K8s) for scalable, production-ready deployment.

Project Setup
-------------
Before starting with Docker and Kubernetes setup, clone the repository to your local machine:

$ git clone https://github.com/your-username/scan-impex.git
$ cd scan-impex

Ensure that your local machine meets the following requirements:
- Docker (for building and running containers)
- Docker Compose (for multi-container orchestration)
- Kubernetes (for deploying the application in the cluster)
- Helm (for managing Kubernetes charts)
- kubectl (for interacting with Kubernetes clusters)

Dockerization
-------------
This section explains how to dockerize the Laravel application and set it up using Docker Compose for local development.

1. Build Docker Image
   The Dockerfile is designed to containerize the Laravel application. It uses official PHP and Laravel dependencies to build the application in a clean and efficient manner.

2. Docker Compose Configuration
   Use docker-compose.yml for setting up multiple containers for services like:
   - Laravel Application
   - MySQL Database
   - Redis Cache

Run the following command to start the application:
$ docker-compose up --build

Kubernetes Setup
----------------
### Provision Infrastructure & Create Cluster

1. Provision Infrastructure: Set up virtual machines or cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, etc.).
2. Create Cluster with Kubeadm:
   - Install Kubernetes on the master node.
   - Use `kubeadm init` to initialize the cluster.
   - Configure the Kubernetes control plane, CRI, and install containerd.

### Configure Networking

1. Install CNI Plugin: Configure the Container Networking Interface (CNI) for Pod networking.
2. DNS Configuration: Set up CoreDNS for internal DNS resolution in the Kubernetes cluster.

### Cluster Node Management

1. Add Worker Nodes: Join any worker nodes to the Kubernetes cluster using `kubeadm join`.
2. kubectl Config File: Set up kubectl to interact with the cluster.

Deploy Application
------------------
1. Deployment: Deploy the application using Kubernetes Deployments for scalable and reliable app delivery.
2. Services: Expose the app externally using Services, including ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer services.
3. Ingress: Configure an Ingress controller to route traffic to the application.
4. Helm: Use Helm for packaging and deploying Kubernetes applications.

Control Access with Users & Permissions
---------------------------------------
1. RBAC (Role-Based Access Control): Set up roles and permissions for users and service accounts.
2. Jenkins & CI/CD Tools: Create service accounts with the necessary permissions for Jenkins and other CI/CD tools.

Troubleshooting
---------------
1. Debug Applications: Use temporary pods to debug issues with applications.
2. Kubectl Debugging: Use kubectl to format output, inspect pod logs, and debug kubeconfig issues.

Multi-Container Pods
--------------------
1. Init Containers: Use Init containers for initialization tasks before the main container runs.
2. Sidecar Containers: Deploy sidecar containers alongside the main container for auxiliary tasks (e.g., logging, monitoring).

Data Persistence
----------------
1. Stateless Services: Configure persistent volumes for stateless services like databases.
2. Volume Types: Explore different types of Kubernetes volumes (e.g., NFS, Persistent Volume Claims).
3. Configure Volumes: Set up persistent storage for data persistence across pods.

External Configuration
----------------------
1. ConfigMap & Secrets: Use Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets to store external configuration and sensitive data.
2. Environment Variables: Configure these values as environment variables or mount them as volumes inside the pods.

Resources Requests & Limits
---------------------------
1. Request & Limit Configuration: Set resource requests and limits for CPU and memory for pods.
2. Manage Resources: Fine-tune the resource allocation to ensure efficient use of cluster resources.

Scheduling Pods
---------------
1. Node Selectors & Affinity: Assign pods to specific nodes using node selectors and affinity rules.
2. Taints & Tolerations: Prevent pods from running on nodes with taints unless they tolerate them.
3. Inter-Pod Affinity: Manage the scheduling of pods based on their relationships with other pods.

Health Probes
-------------
1. Liveness Probes: Configure liveness probes to check the health of running containers.
2. Readiness Probes: Configure readiness probes to manage the availability of the pods.

Deployment Strategies
---------------------
1. Replicasets: Use ReplicaSets to ensure high availability and horizontal scaling of applications.
2. Deployment Strategies: Rollback and update deployments using various deployment strategies (e.g., RollingUpdate, Recreate).

Etcd Backup & Restore
----------------------
1. Etcd Store: Understand how Etcd stores critical Kubernetes cluster data.
2. Backup: Learn how to back up Etcd data.
3. Restore: Restore Etcd data in case of cluster failures.

Kubernetes REST API
-------------------
1. Kubernetes API Structure: Understand how the Kubernetes API is structured and how to interact with it.
2. Access the REST API: Access the Kubernetes REST API either via kubectl or directly through the API server.

Cluster Upgrade
---------------
1. Cluster Upgrade: Learn how to upgrade Kubernetes clusters to the latest stable version.
2. Demos: Provide demonstrations of the upgrade process.

Multiple Clusters
-----------------
1. Kube Context: Work with multiple clusters using kubectl contexts.
2. Switching Contexts: Use context switching to interact with different clusters.

Certification Management
------------------------
1. Check & Renew Certificates: Learn how to check the status of Kubernetes certificates and renew them when necessary.

Secure Cluster with Network Policies
------------------------------------
1. Network Policies: Restrict communication between pods and services using Network Policies.
2. Demo Network Policies: Provide a demonstration of enforcing communication restrictions between applications.

CI/CD Integration with Jenkins
------------------------------
Set up Jenkins as a CI/CD tool to automate the deployment process.

Steps:
1. Install Jenkins in Kubernetes: Deploy Jenkins on Kubernetes using Helm.
2. CI/CD Pipeline: Create Jenkins pipelines to automate builds, tests, and deployments.
3. Service Accounts for Jenkins: Use service accounts with appropriate permissions for Jenkins to access the Kubernetes API.
